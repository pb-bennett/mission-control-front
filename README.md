# mission-control-back

a map app to help encourage my children to be more active and explore surrounding areas on foot and on bicycle.

Aims:
A backend using node.js, express and mongodb via mongoose to store users and locations. A frontend using vanilla js and leaflet to display and add locations as the mission controller and then visit and upload photos of the locations to prove completion as the misioneer.

Recoloured Leaflet icons from: https://github.com/pointhi/leaflet-color-markers - thanks!
